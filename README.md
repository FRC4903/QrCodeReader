# QrCodeReader
The program which reads the data from the scouting app and appends it into a csv corresponding to the team number

[Download](https://github.com/FRC4903/QrCodeReader/releases) the latest release from the releases tab on github

## Running the app
Run the .exe file inside of it's own folder for best results  
Show the QR code to the camera and it should create a new csv file for the team if not already prexisting
If it's a pit scouting app qr code it should append the data to the prexisting PitScouting.csv file

#### _If it crashes just run it again I'm not sure why it will crash sometimes it shouldn't matter because the data saves anyway_
